  The recent $NuStar$ observation of a high-energy cutoff at around 10
  keV in the X-ray spectrum of the quiescent accreting neutron star
  Cen X-4 ($L_{\rm x} \sim 10^{33}$ ergs/s) provides a direct strong
  constraint on the temperature and other properties of the emitting
  gas. As reported in Chakrabarty et al. 2014, the relatively soft
  cutoff combined with the hard power-law index (of $\Gamma \sim 1.5$)
  suggests bremsstrahlung emission rather than Comptonization is the
  dominant emission mechanism. However, we demonstrate in this paper,
  the large number density of hot electrons combined with the
  near-balance between thermal and non-thermal components implies that
  the non-thermal emission is produced in a boundary layer near the
  stellar surface rather than in the accretion flow itself. Given that
  10-70\% of the accretion flow energy is predicted to be released in
  a boundary layer, the non-detection of the accretion flow provides
  the first direct evidence that this flow is indeed
  `radiatively-inefficient' i.e most of the gravitational potential
  energy released by the flow before it hits the star is not emitted
  as radiation. We set constraints on the radiative inefficiency of
  the flow for different assumptions for the magnetic field of the
  star (which, if present, clears the inner regions near the star and
  could decrease the overal radiative efficiency), and make predictions for
  the spectrum of systems with both a detectable RIAF and bright
  central object.

\section{Introduction}

It is still not established how accretion flows organize themselves at
the very low luminosities observed in many accreting black hole and
neutron star systems. When these sources are much brighter (near the
Eddington luminosity; $L_{\rm Edd} \equiv 4\pi GM m_{\rm p}
c/\sigma_{\rm T} = 1.3\times10^{38} (M/M_\odot) {\rm erg\;s}^{-1}$)
their energy spectrum is dominated by a blackbody that peaks in the
hard UV (for supermassive black holes) or soft X-rays (for galactic
black holes and neutron stars), which is interpreted to be an
optically thick gas disc (as predicted by [Shakura \& Sunyaev, Pringle
\& Rees, Thorne \& ?]). As the luminosity declines however, the energy
spectrum evolves into a hard X-ray power law, indicating it is emitted
by optically thin gas $\sim$1000 times hotter than what the classic
`thin disc' \citep{1973A&A....24..337S} solution would predict for the
observed luminosity. The precise physical origin of this component is
still not clear.

More than 30 years ago, [Rees et al., 1982] proposed that this
spectral change could be caused by a radical change in the accretion
flow's structure below a critical accretion rate whereby the accretion
flow would inflate vertically from a cool dense thin disc into a much
hotter, optically thin torus. As a result, the accretion flow would
become {\it radiatively inefficient}, meaning that a large fraction of
the energy liberated by accretion is not radiated away but instead
converted into some other form of energy (such as kinetic or internal
potential energy).  This is an important distinction from the standard
thin-disc solution, where the accretion energy is efficiently radiated
away from the disc as it accretes. Radiative inefficiency implies that
the accretion rate in such a flow could be orders of magnitude higher
than if the flow were radiatively efficient. [significance of this?
Why does this matter?]

Unfortunately it is not straightforward to build a self-consistent
dynamic model for how a radiatively-inefficient accretion flow
(hereafter RIAF) actually works. The large scaleheight of the flow
allows the potential for large-scale radial and vertical gas motions,
which can correspond to large-scale energy and momentum
transport. This large-scale transport cannot happen in the standard
`thin-disc' solution, since it by definition assumes that the orbital
velocity is nearly Keplerian and radial and vertical velocities are
much smaller. The uncertainty over energy transport relates closely to
another major unsolved question: Given that the ultimate source of
energy is the gravitational potential of the central object, and that
all of the gas must liberate this energy in order to accrete at all,
another major question is also: where does the `missing'
(i.e. non-radiated) energy go?

Since the early 1990's there has been considerable theoretical
interest in RIAF solutions, with several main proposals. The most
well-known one, the `Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow' (ADAF)
solution [CITE Narayan \& Yi], assumes that the accretion flow becomes
so tenuous that the electrons and ions are no longer collisionally
coupled. Turbulent viscosity heats the gas, but since the ions mainly
cool via collisions, the ion gas temperature can rise to its virial
temperature ($\sim 10-100~{\rm MeV}$). Gravitational potential energy is
thus efficiently converted into internal potential energy of the ions,
which is then advected inwards and disappears into the black
hole. 

Other solutions focus on reducing the net accretion rate into the
deepest part of the potential well near the central object. One
popular set of solutions assumes that most of the energy liberated close to
the central object is advected outward and used to launch an large
outflow of gas far from the central potential, so that the net
accretion rate decreases strongly closer to the star BEGELMANN.  It
has also been suggested that the flow could become
'convection'-dominated (with large-scale vertical or radial convection
cells and a small net accretion rate inward) CITE, or
'magnetically'-dominated (in which poloidal magnetic field is advected
inward from large distances and creates a magnetic barrier against
accretion) [CITE].

Observationally, there is some evidence that RIAFs exist. For example,
at the centre of our our galaxy, gas from [WHAT??] is observed to fall
towards Sgr A* at a rate of xxx, yet the maximum observed luminosity
for Sgr A* is only xxx. Recently, Wang et al. (2014) presented
evidence that xxx much less efficient. [model dependent??]

Proof of radiative inefficiency is typically indirect: the
inflow rate of gas is measured at a much larger distances than where
most of the accretion energy is liberated. The
`radiatively-inefficient' part of the flow only exists close to the
star (in the inner $\sim 1000 R_g$, where $R_g \equiv GM_*/c^2 = xxx $
is the gravitational radius and $M_*$ is the mass of the central
object). The extremely small size scale, low luminosity and high
energy of the emission all mean that the amount of information about
the innermost regions of the flow itself is inevitably very limited,
while the large distance between the outer edge of the accretion flow
and the innermost regions is essentially undetectable. This leaves
open the possibility that the gas flow is disrupted in this
intermediate region, and the innermost part of the accretion flow may
not, after all, be radiatively inefficient. Theoretical studies of
RIAFs have generally focused on building self-similar dynamical
solutions [precise, concise definition of self-similar] and have not
not paid much attention to what will happen at the innermost boundary
of the flow, where it interacts with the central compact object. This
is in line with observational work, which has mainly focused on black
hole systems, in which all the gas ultimately ends up inside the hole
and does not radiate.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item{{\bf WORK INTO TEXT}`Radiative efficiency' means efficiency with which
%     grav. pot. energy is radiated away. In an optically thick disk,
%     energy is radiated locally, efficiency depends on location of
%     inner edge of accretion disk: the deeper the well the more
%     efficient the radiation. In an optically thin disk this isn't
%     clear. In particular, if density drops sufficiently, get a
%     two-temperature plasma and most of the accretion energy is stored

%     energy transport in disk (cf. ADIOS model, where most energy is
%     transported to very large radii to launch powerful outflows)}
% \end{itemize}

However, many neutron stars in accreting binary systems show similar
spectral and variability properties as black holes (suggesting similar
accretion physics is at work), but here the interaction between the
accretion flow and surface layer is very important. Accreting gas will
release 10-70\% of its total gravitational potential energy in a
boundary layer as it settles onto the star. In most circumstances this
final fall will be radiatively efficient, so that the luminosity from
the stellar surface should be a good proxy (to within a factor of a
few) for the accretion rate onto the star and hence in the inner parts
of the accretion flow. [cite]

%  Accreting neutron stars often also
% have detectable magnetic fields, as seen by pulsed emission at the
% stellar spin frequency. The strong magnetic field controls the motion
% of the flow in the regions close to the star, so that the inner
% accretion flow is truncated some distance from the star, and gas is
% channelled onto the star along field lines, producing hot spots at the
% magnetic poles of the star and consequently pulsations as the hot
% spots rotate with the star.

If the uncertainties in the neutron star's properties (such as spin,
size and magnetic field) can be constrained, the luminosity of the
boundary layer could offer insights on the accretion flow's
properties. For example: if the majority of the accretion energy is
advected inwards (ADAF) rather than used to expel gas, the surface of
the neutron star will be much brighter {begelmann blandford}. Indeed,
the relative brightness of neutron star transients compared with black
holes has been used as evidence of the existence of both an event
horizon {narayan} and an ADAF {done and gierlinski}.

All the same, comparing relative luminosities of neutron stars and
black holes is a somewhat weak argument for the existence of RIAFs,
since the mean accretion rate {\it into} the RIAF is essentially
impossible to determine and even the mean mass transfer rate from the
secondary companion can be uncertain up to an order of magnitude. This
has led to some contradictory results: for example {Done \&
  Gierlinski} , {others?} argued that the spectrum of xxxxxx is
consistent with an ADAF model, while {Menou \& McClintock} fit another
neutron star binary, Centaurus X-4, with an ADAF spectral model and
found a large discrepency between the accretion rate onto the star and
the predicted accretion rate from the ADAF model.

% The presence of a magnetic field further complicates the situation,
% although in a somewhat predictable way. Since the magnetic field of
% the star interacts directly with the flow, the different rotation
% rates allow angular momentum exchange between the Keplerian (or nearly
% Keplerian) accretion flow and the field lines (which rotate with the
% star). This leads to two distinct regimes, depending on whether the
% star rotates faster or slower than the inner edge of the accretion
% flow. If the star rotates more slowly than the flow, the interaction
% between the field and disc will add angular momentum to the star and
% allow accretion to proceed. If on the other hand the star is spinning
% faster than the inner part of the flow, the magnetic field will create a
% centrifugal barrier that inhibits accretion onto the star. This is
% often known as the `propeller' regime, since the magnetic field is
% assumed to expel gas at the inner edge of the flow and spin down the
% star. The point at which the two spin rates are equal is the
% `co-rotation radius' ($r_{\rm corot} \equiv (GM_*/\Omega_*^2)^{1/3}$;
% $M_*$ and $\Omega_*$ are the stellar mass and spin frequency), and
% this radius marks the transition point between accretion and propeller
% regimes.

% {\tt no need for this twice...}
% Recent work has pointed out that a centrifugal barrier that inhibits
% accretion does not necessarily result in a strong outflow [ST93,
% DS10/DS12]. Instead the angular momentum added by the field/flow
% interaction can be viscously transported outward, which changes the
% density structure of the flow [cite] and reduce the accretion rate
% onto the star. The inner edge of the disc will then become `stuck'
% near the co-rotation radius, and accretion onto the star can continue
% down to arbitrarily low accretion rates so that the disk never moves
% to the propeller regime [DS11]. While all work on accretion
% flow-magnetic field interactions has focused on high density thin
% accretion discs, many of the results should also apply to RIAFs
% (although investigating how a RIAF will interact with a magnetic field
% is an interesting and unconsidered problem which may lead to further
% observational constraints on the nature of the flow). {\tt two ideas
%   here: explan dead disk explicitly?}

% How will the central magnetic field affect the observed luminosity of
% the flow? First, the field will truncate the accretion flow before it
% reaches the deepest part of the potential well. This will reduce the
% amount of gravitational potential energy that the flow liberates
% before it finally falls onto the star, and so reduce the amount of
% energy available for radiating or driving an outflow{\footnote {The
%   interaction between the magnetic field and the flow will add some
%   amount of energy to the flow, of order xxx, which is disregarded in
%   this work}. Thus, compared to an unmagnetized neutron star, one with
% a strong magnetic field should have more luminosity coming from the
% surface of the star (which we assume to radiate efficiently) and less
% coming from the accretion flow itself. If it exists, a magnetic
% `propeller' in contrast will increase the radiative contribution of
% the flow versus a boundary layer, since in this scenario little or no
% gas actually hits the star. If instead the flow stays truncated near
% the co-rotation radius and gas continues to hit the surface of the
% star even at very low accretion rates (the `dead disc' picture
% suggested by [cite]), the radiative efficiency will increase compared
% to the same accretion rate in a black hole.

Observationally, a major challenge in constraining RIAF models has
been to constrain the physical properties of the hard X-ray
non-thermal component of the energy spectrum beyond fitting it with a
power law. This is due in large part to the low photon flux from many
sources and reduced sensitivity of X-ray instruments above $\sim$10
keV. Of particular interest is constraining the turnover in the
powerlaw spectrum at high energies, which can put strong constraints
on the energy distribution and dominant emission mechanism of the
radiating gas. New X-ray missions such as {\it NuSTAR} have been
designed with unprecedented sensitivity at high X-ray energies and
will give the opportunity to answer some of these questions. {\tt This
  is still kind of fuzzy, is this exactly what I want to say?}

%  Optically-thin high
% temperature gas generically produces a power-law energy spectrum
% (especially given the limited sensitivity of X-ray telescopes) , with
% different indices and high energy cutoffs for different radiative
% mechanisms (e.g. free-free [Bremsstrahlung] emission versus inverse
% componization) and gas properties (temperature, density, particle
% energy distribution). X-ray observatories have much less sensitivity
% at high X-ray energies, which has historially made many physical
% models indistinguishable. For example, without detecting any spectral
% turnover at high energies, a very hard power-law X-ray spectrum can be
% equally well fit with a model assuming Bremsstrahlung emission from
% relatively low density and high temperature gas or Inverse Compton
% scattering from gas of a higher density and lower temperature (as was
% demonstrated in the fits presented in Chakrabarty+2014). If the
% dominant radiation mechanism is inverse Compton scattering of seed
% photons through a hot plasma, the power-law index will depend on the
% Compton `y' parameter, which has a degeneracy between optical depth
% and temperature. This degeneracy can only be broken by detecting a
% high-energy cutoff in the spectrum, which indicates the temperature of
% the seed photons. {\tt d/n really discuss energy distribution of seed
%   photons...} An increased sensitivity in high X-ray bands will thus
% add much-needed spectral information that can help constrain the
% physics operating in the flow.
Recently, the detection of a high-energy X-ray cutoff in hard X-ray
spectrum of the quiescent neutron star binary Cen X-4 (X1455-214) was
reported by [Chakrabarty+]. This observation presented an excellent
chance to put constraints on the non-thermal gas and potentially test
ideas of radiative efficiency outlined above. Cen X-4 is the brightest
`quiescent' neutron star binary in the sky, with an distance of only
1.2-1.4 kpc [Chevalier, kuulkers, Gonzalez-Hernandez] and a mean
luminosity of around $10^{31}-10^{32}$ ergs/s (6-7 orders of magnitude
less than $L_{\rm Edd}$) [cite]. The source is strongly variable, with
X-ray variability by a factor two over a matter of minutes
[Chakrabarty], and up to more than an order of magnitude over several
days [Bernardini]. The X-ray spectrum shows two distinct components, a
thermal component with a temperature of around 0.08 keV (ascribed to
the neutron star surface) and a power law tail (of unknown origin)
with an index that varies between $\Gamma \sim 1-2$. Both components
make up roughly equal contributions to the spectrum, and co-vary on
timescales of at least 110s [Bernardini].

In their January 2013 observation, [Chakrabarty+] found evidence of a
break or cutoff in the hard X-rays around 10 keV, while the index of
the power-law component below 10keV was quite hard: $\Gamma =
1.4$. They considered different radiation processes and physical
scenarios for the high energy emission, before concluding that the
spectrum was most likely produced by bremsstrahlung radiation from a
hot massive outflow at a large distance from the star, roughly as
predicted the model suggested by [begelmann and blandford]. 

However, there are several problems with this suggested scenario,
which we discuss in detail in this paper. The first one is an
energetic inconsistency: the amount of energy required to power the
outflowing accretion flow proposed by Chakrabarty+2014 is several
times larger than is available by the proposed accretion rate.  The
second is that the thermal and non-thermal components vary together on
timescales as short as $\sim 100{\rm s}$, which is much shorter than
the time it takes the gas from the outer regions to accrete onto the
surface where the thermal emission originates. 

In this paper, we refit and reinterpret the observed X-ray spectrum
and demonstrate that the power-law component is most plausibly
produced by bremsstrahlung emission from the boundary layer on the
surface of the star. This means that all the observed emission is
coming from near the surface of the star, and the non-thermal and
thermal components are coupled both radiatively and through particle
exchange. Most significantly, if all the emission is coming from the
stellar surface, this implies that the flow itself is completely
undetected, i.e. it is indeed radiatively inefficient. This is the
first direct, model-independent evidence for radiative inefficiency in
any accreting system.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:models} we
review how much emission is expected to come from a neutron star
boundary layer and accretion flow, and how the neutron star's size,
spin and magnetic field can affect this balance. In Section
\ref{sec:CenX4} we discuss the observed history of Cen X-4, and
present the results of a search for pulsations that would indicate the
presence of a magnetic field.  In Section \ref{sec:phys_proc} we
re-investigate the model proposed by [Chakrabarty] and explain why it
is not energetically plausible. We then investigate different options
to explain the spectrum, including Inverse Compton scattering and
bremsstrahlung from both the stellar surface boundary layer and the
accretion flow, and conclude that the only plausible model is
bremsstrahlung from the surface layers. We also set rough limits on
the scale height and density of the boundary layer; a more complete
analysis of the physical constraints imposed by this observation and
others will follow in a separate paper. Finally, in section
\ref{sec:RIAF} we calculate upper limits for the radiative
inefficiency of the accretion flow, and discuss briefly how future
observations of low-level accretion onto neutron stars can be used to
put better constraints on the radiative efficiency of the accretion
flow.

\section{How accretion energy is liberated in neutron stars}
\label{sec:models}

What fraction of the gravitational potential energy from accretion
will be liberated in the boundary layer of the neutron star?  This
question is central to the argument of this paper: to put constraints
on the radiative efficiency of the accretion flow we need to know how
bright we expect it to be relative to the emission from the
boundary layer. The total rate of gravitational potential energy released by
matter accreting onto a star is:
\begin{equation}
\dot{E}_{\rm pot} = \frac{GM_*\dot{M}}{R_*},
\end{equation}
divided into energy released in the flow, \fflow and the boundary
layer \fbl. In the absence of other physical considerations about the
central object, \fbl$\simeq$\fflow$\simeq 0.5$. However, this balance
can be altered by the neutron star's size, spin and magnetic field,
although in general (and for Cen X-4 in particular) we expect these
effects to be small. Below we review the effects of each of these
properties and its implication for the energetic release in the
boundary layer and accretion flow.

% The
% central argument of this paper is that the observed X-ray luminosity
% from Cen X-4 is generated close to the surface of the star, and that
% the accretion flow itself is not detected, implying that the accretion
% flow is radiatively inefficient. This argument hinges on two points:
% the first that the properties of the X-ray spectrum are most plausibly
% explained by emission from the stellar surface (which we argue in
% section \ref{sec:phys_proc}), the second that the non-detection of the
% accretion flow is evidence of radiative inefficiency. This second
% point requires understanding where the gravitational potential energy
% is liberated in a neutron star binary system: namely, what fraction is
% released in the accretion flow versus a boundary layer on the star. 
% In
% a large, non-magnetic, non-spinning neutron star, the total
% gravitational potential energy ($GM_*\dot{M}/R$) will be divided
% equally between the boundary layer/surface of the star and the
% accretion disc.  This balance can be altered by several properties of
% the neutron star: its size, spin rate and magnetic field.  In general
% these effects tend to reduce the brightness of the accretion flow in
% comparison with the stellar surface (with the exception of a strong
% magnetocentrifugally-driven outflow). However, for realistic neutron
% stars, the amount of energy released at the surface and in the
% accretion flow should be within a factor of a few of each other. This
% implies that a non-detection of the accretion flow indicates the flow
% itself is radiatively inefficient.

\subsection{Neutron star size}
In the absence of the magnetic field, the accretion flow will extend
close to the neutron star's surface and the effects of General
Relativity will become important. This has been discussed in some
detail first by Shakura \& Sunyaev (1986) (who dealt chiefly with
non-spinning neutron stars) and more recently in papers by xxxxxx who
consider a spinning neutron star. 

The main point is that the neutron star radius can be smaller than the
innermost stable circular orbit -- the smallest radius for which bound
orbits exist in a Schwarzchild metric, $R_* < R_{\rm isco} = 6R_{\rm g}$,
where $R_{\rm g}$ is the gravitational radius of the neutron
star. Inside this orbit the gas will be decoupled from the rest of the
accretion flow and hence stop radiating away gravitational
energy. Shakura\&Sunyaev calculated the energy released in the flow
and the boundary layer in a Schwarzchild metric. Expressed as first
order corrections to the Newtonian energy release, the fraction of
energy from the boundary layer and flow will be:

\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{F}_{\rm bl} &=& 0.5 \left(1 + \frac{R_{\rm} g}{R_{*}}\right)\\
\nonumber \mathcal{F}_{\rm flow} &=& 0.5 \left(1 - \frac{R_{\rm
      g}}{2R_*}\right).
\end{eqnarray}

The uncertainty in the neutron star equation of state means this
number is uncertain, but even over the whole range of possible
equations of state (from consulting e.g. fig. xx of Lattimer \&
PRakash 2001) this effect will be very small even for a $2M_\odot$
star (where the effect is largest): \beq 1.3 \leq \frac{\mathcal{F}_{\rm
    bl}}{\mathcal{F}_{\rm flow}} \leq 1.5 \eeq and $\mathcal{F}_{\rm
  bl}/\mathcal{F}_{\rm flow} < 1.3 $ for a $1.5 M_\odot$ star. A rapidly
spinning star will distort space time near the stellar surface and
reduce $r_{\rm isco}$, but this effect will just reduce the imbalance
between \fbl and \fflow. Even for a very small neutron star, a large
fraction of energy will be released in the flow. 

\subsection{Spinning near break-up}
If the star is relatively large (so the inner edge of the disc reaches
the stellar surface) and rapidly spinning, the spin will also
influence the relative contribution from the disc and the magnetic
field [popham narayan; paczynski]. As the star approaches its break-up
frequency (2170 Hz for a $1.4M_\odot$, $10{\rm km}R_*$ neutron star),
the inner boundary of the disc must transport stellar angular momentum
outward from the star in order for accretion to continue (this is
known as a `maximally-torqued' inner boundary condition). This
increases the amount of radiation from the flow to \fbl = 0.75 and
decreases the stellar contribution (cite paczynski, popham \&
narayan).  The fraction of energy from the boundary layer will be:

\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{F}_{\rm BL} = \frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{\Omega_*}{\Omega_K(R_*)}\right)^2.
\end{equation}

Although this could in principle considerably reduce radiation from
the boundary layer of the star, the fastest confirmed millisecond
pulsar has a spin frequency of 716 Hz, so that the boundary layer
luminosity will only be reduced by about a factor 2 compared with a
non-spinning star. The spin frequency of a neutron star is believed to
be limited by gravitational wave emission above $\sim1000$Hz [cite],
so the effect of spin rate will probably not influence the
surface/disc luminosity balance more than a factor of $\sim$2. If Cen
X-4 has a millisecond spin frequency and is non-magnetic, less energy
will be released in the boundary layer than the accretion flow,
increasing the radiative inefficiency of the flow.

\subsection{Magnetospheric effects}
The largest potential influence on the surface/accretion flow energy
balance will come from a strong stellar magnetic field that truncates
the inner part of the accretion flow and channels accreting material
onto the stellar surface. This has two main effects: first, since the
inner edge of the flow is now much further from the star, the amount
of energy released in the flow will be smaller by a factor of $R_{\rm
  in}/R_{*}$. Secondly, if the star is spinning very rapidly and the
truncation radius is sufficiently far from the star, the magnetic
field/accretion-flow interaction may be able to drive an outflow (the
``propeller'' effect; Illarionov \& Sunyaev) and reduce the amount of
accretion onto the neutron star's surface, which could dramatically
reduce the luminosity of the system. As we show below, however, the
propeller effect may not often occur, while the lack of detected
pulsations (\ref{sec:CenX4}) suggest it is unlikely to be operating in Cen X-4.

The inner edge of the accretion flow can be defined as the point where
the magnetic field is strong enough to enforce co-rotation of gas
(CITE ST93):
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:rm}
r_{\rm m}\!\!\!\! &=&\!\!\! \mu^{2/5} (4\Omega_*\dot{M})^{-1/5}\\
\nonumber\!\!\!\!&=&\!\!\! 2.3\times10^6 \!\left(\frac{B}{10^8\rm{~G}}\right)^{2/5}\!\!\!\left(\frac{P_*}{2\times10^{-3}{\rm
      ~s}}\right)^{1/5}\!\!\!\left(\frac{\dot{M}}{4.3\times10^{-12} {\rm g~s^{-1}}}\right).  
\end{eqnarray}
In this equation, $\mu = B_*R_*^3$ is the magnetic moment of the star,
$\Omega_*$ ($P_*$) is its spin frequency (period) and $\dot{M}$ the
mass accretion rate through the disc. The quantities have been scaled
to a weak magnetic field, rapidly-spinning neutron star in outburst
(at $\sim0.01\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$, or $L_{\rm X} \sim
10^{36}$).\footnote{Equation \ref{eq:rm} predicts a somewhat smaller
  truncation radius than the more commonly used prescription (Ghosh \&
  Lamb; Pringle \& Rees) which equates the ram pressure of the
  infalling gas and magnetic field of the star without considering the
  relative rotation between the two.} For a weakly magnetic rapidly
spinning star, truncation by a magnetic field will thus decrease the
luminosity from the accretion flow ($L_{\rm flow} \simeq
GM_*\dot{M}/2R_{\rm in}$ by a factor of about 2 compared with the
unmagnetized case (when the source is fairly bright) and force a
steeper relationship between luminosity and accretion rate ($L_{\rm
  flow} \propto \dot{M}^{6/5}$ versus a $\propto \dot{M}$). The
stronger the magnetic field, the further away $r_{\rm m}$, and hence
the smaller \fflow will be.

The biggest uncertainty for magnetospheric accretion however, is what
exactly happens when the accretion rate decreases so much that the
inner radius of the flow predicted by (eq. \ref{eq:rm}) moves outside
the co-rotation radius-- $r_{\rm c} \equiv
(GM_*/\Omega_*^2)^{1/3}$--the point where the disc and the star rotate
at the same rate. If the inner edge of the disc lies outside this
point, the rotating magnetic field creates a centrifugal barrier and
can prevent matter from accreting onto the star. It is commonly
assumed that the matter accreting through the disc will be expelled
when it hits the centrifugal barrier of the star -- the ``propeller''
effect.

In a strong propeller (where most of the accretion flow is expelled)
the flow's intrinsic radiative efficiency becomes impossible to
determine without a good model for how the magnetic field actually
expels material. The luminosity from the stellar surface will depend
on the net accretion rate onto the star (which presumably decreases
non-linearly with the accretion rate at the inner edge of the flow),
while the luminosity from the disc will decrease with the accretion
rate of the flow as $L \propto \dot{M}^{6/5}$. 

Recent work has demonstrated that a propeller is not inevitable in
magnetospheric accretion. ST93 noted that in order to efficiently
drive an outflow, the amount of energy added to the disc as it
interacts with the star must be large enough to accelerate gas to at
least least its escape velocity. This will not be the case when the
disc is truncated close to the corotation radius. As a result, the
magnetic field can act as a barrier instead of a propeller: some gas is
confined by the magnetic field while the remainder is able to accrete
through the barrier, either steadily or in bursts of accretion. The
inner edge of the disc remains very close to \rc, and is no longer
given by eq. \ref{eq:rm} DS10/11/12 studied this solution in more {\tt
  describe more accurately why those papers are new: describes the
  dead disc state where barrier is established, predicts size of reservoir}
detail and found that this `magnetic barrier' can change the gas
structure of the disc, from the standard accreting disc solution to a
`dead disc' solution first derived by Shakura \& Sunyaev, and that
accretion onto the star can continue down to arbitrarily low accretion
rates.

Forming a dead disc rather than a propeller will have important
consequences for the radiative efficiency of the flow. Once the inner
edge of the accretion flow has moved outward close to \rc it will
remain confined there, so that the accretion luminosity in the disc
will be proportional to $\dot{M}$ rather than $\dot{M}^{6/5}$. A dead
disc solution also have considerably more mass than a standard
accretion disc for the same accretion rate, so the surface density of
the flow will be larger than the equivalent `propeller' solution. This
may be relevant if the flow is an optically thin RIAF, since the
increased density will increase its radiative efficiency. {\tt there will be a
  figure to show how \fbl and \fflow change as  a function of
  accretion rate, both for a dead disc and for a propelling disc}

What is the magnetic field in Cen X-4? A strong propeller was first
invoked for Cen X-4 in (Menou \& McClintock), in order to explain the
observed hard X-ray emission as originating from an ADAF. If the
majority of the gravitational potential energy is not radiated but
instead advected onto the surface of the star (as the ADAF model
predicts), the surface should be orders of magnitude brighter than the
accretion flow, which is contrary to observations. Indeed, even for a
`weak' field of $10^{7}-10^{8}$G, the low observed accretion rates and
a millisecond spin period would put Cen X-4 in the `propeller'
regime. However, we see no firm evidence for magnetic behaviour, and
in particular no evidence for pulsations (sec. \ref{sec:CenX4}), which
would indicate organized, channelled accretion flows. It thus seems
unlikely (and as we show in the next section, unnecessary) that a
strong magnetic field is substantially altering Cen X-4's accretion
flow.

In summary, while there are various effects that will decrease the
luminosity of the star or the accretion flow so that the observed
emission from either is considerably less than would be expected from
the amount of mass accreted, all these effects except a strong
magnetic propeller will change the balance by factors of order unity,
wherease the RIAF models generally predict the radiative efficiency
wil be reduced by several orders of magnitude. We therefore expect to
be able to test RIAF models with reasonably good deep observations of
neutron stars in quiescence.

\section{Observations of Cen X-4}
\label{sec:CenX4}
Cen X--4 has been observed in quiescence with \textit{XMM–Newton} on
200X XX XXX (MJD XXXXX) for a total on-source exposure time of
${\sim}80$ ks. The \textit{XMM–Newton} telescope (Jansen et al. 2001)
consists of three 1500 cm$^2$ X-ray telescopes with an EPIC instrument
in each focus, a Reflecting Grating Spectrometer (RGS; den Herder et
al. 2001) and an Optical Monitor (Mason et al. 2001). The EPIC-pn
detector (Strder et al. 2001) operated in timing mode (with thin
filter), recording data with high time resolution with a sampling time
of $29.56\rm\,\mu\,s$.  Since we are looking for pulsations from a
millisecond pulsar, we selected only data coming from the EPIC-pn CCD.

 Data have been processed using SAS version X.X.X, and we have
 employed the most updated calibration files (CCF) available at the
 time the reduction was performed (May 2014).  The photons are
 filtered by applying stantard screening criteria and by removing
 solar flares and telemetry dropouts.  After filtering the total net
 exposure time is 68.5 ks.


\section{Semi-Coherent Search}

To inspect for the presence of X-ray pulsations we adopted a
semi-coherent search strategy \citep{messenger2011}.  Given a certain
finite amount of computational time, the semi-coherent
search divides the data in short segments of length $\Delta T$. In a
first step, each segment is searched \textit{coherently}. Then the
different segments are combined incoherently. An extensive description
of the technique can be found in \citet{messenger2011,
  something-more?} and in \citet{Messenger\&Patruno} where the same
scheme has been adopted to search for pulsations in the low-mass
X-ray binary Aql X--1.

During the search we assumed a circular orbit and no prior knowledge
of the orbital phase whereas we restricted the orbital period and
semi-major axis according to the values reported in \citet{someone}
(see also Table~\ref{tab:parspace}).  To avoid the influence of
possible unreported systematics we extended the boundaries used for
the orbital period. We also assumed a constant fractional amplitude of
the pulsations for the entire duration of the observations. 

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\hline \hline
Parameter & Units & Min & Max \\ 
%
\hline
%
$\nu$ & Hz & 50 & 1500\\
$a$ & lt-s & 0.04 & 1.9 \\
%$\Omega$ & rad/sec & $9.0903\times 10^{-5}$ & $9.4342\times 10^{-5}$ \
$P$ & s & 54000 & 54720 \\
$T_{\mathrm{asc}}$ & s & \multicolumn{2}{c}{full orbit}\\
\hline \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{The parameter space boundaries for the Cen X--4 search.
\label{tab:parspace}}
\end{table}
%

We divided the data into segments of $\Delta T=128$ s that we searched
coherently.  We then combined incoherently the detection statistics of each segment for a total of
34.2 billion trials. Our expected theoretical sensitivity for a
multi-trial false alarm of $1\%$ and a false dismissal probability of
$10\%$ is 6.8\% rms. We detect no significant pulsations with a
fractional amplitude upper limit of 6.44\%. 

\section{How is the quiescent spectrum of Cen X-4 produced?}
\label{sec:phys_proc}
The key observational characteristics of the quiescent spectrum in Cen
X-4 are detailed above. They are: a roughly equal thermal and
non-thermal x-ray spectral components that co-vary in luminosity on
short ($<100$s) timecales. There is also excess UV and optical
emission that correlates with X-ray variability and suggests
reprocessing either in the outer accretion disc or the surface of the
companion star ([earlier work as well, Bernardini+ 2014]). The rapid
and simultaneous variability in all wavelengths and spectral
components suggests that accretion energy is the main source of
luminosity as opposed to, e.g. cooling in the neutron star crust
[REFERENCE]. The non-thermal component has a relatively hard spectrum
($\Gamma \simeq 1.4-2$) and, in the recent observation of
[Chakrabarty+2014] shows clear evidence of a break around 10-20
keV. This component is most likely produced by optically thin emission
from relatively hot gas, while the thermal component is presumably the
neutron star surface. 

Below we discuss why the non-thermal emission likely does not
originate in the accretion flow (as suggested by Chakrabarty+2014),
and propose instead that this component originates from optically thin
thermal bremsstrahlung in the boundary layer of the star. As described
in sec. \ref{sec:models}, in most circumstances at least 30\% of the
total accretion energy is released in this boundary layer, and this
energy is expected to be mainly radiated away.

\subsection{Why the observed high-energy X-ray spectrum does not
  originate in the accretion flow}
\label{sec:chakra}
\subsubsection{The `ADIOS' proposal from Chakrabarty+2014}

The model presented by Chakrabarty+2014 attributes the non-thermal
spectral component to an `ADIOS' flow -- a radiatively-inefficient
flow model proposed by Blandford and Begelmann 99 in which
gravitational potential energy released by infall is primarily used to
heat the accreting gas and launch a strong outflow of gas from the
flow. As a result the net accretion rate inward is a strong function
of radius:
\begin{equation}
\dot{M}(r) = \dot{M}(r_{\rm in})\left(\frac{r}{r_{\rm in}}\right)^p
\end{equation}
where $ 0 \leq p < 1$ is a scaling parameter for the local accretion
rate as a function of radius: $p = 0$ gives the standard solution (no
outflow), while $p < 1$ is imposed so that the gravitational energy
released increases with decreasing radius.  If the wind is very strong
and the RIAF extends across the inner $\sim10^4 R_{\rm S}$ of the
flow, the accretion rate at the inner edge of the accretion flow is
four orders of magnitude of lower than at the outer edge where the
flow begins.

To fit the observed Cen X-4 spectrum, Chakrabarty+2014 assume that the
electron gas in the entire flow has a temperature of $18~{\rm keV}$
(since the flow is a two-temperature plasma, the proton temperature
can be orders of magnitude higher). Since the accretion rate increases
with radius, there is much more gas and hence more emission in the
outer disc regions. They assume that the total luminosity from the
source corresponds to the net accretion rate onto the star at $r_{\rm
  in}$ so that $\dot{M} \simeq 4\times10^{-6}\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$. They
adopt a quasi-spherical geometry for the flow with a radial velocity
$v_{\rm R} = \eta \sqrt{(GM_*/R)}; \eta \simeq 0.1$ (a standard
assumption for RIAFs), which gives the density of the gas as a
function of radius. The emission function of gas producing
bremsstrahlung is (CITE Rybicki and Lightman; assuming ionized
hydrogen and a Gaunt factor of 1.2) :
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:brems}
U_{\rm ff} = 1.22\times10^{-27} n_e^2T_e^{1/2} \rm {erg}~\rm{s^{-1}}~\rm{cm^{-3}},
\end{equation}
so the strength of the non-thermal component can be used to obtain the
required density profile and hence constrain $p$.  To fit the observed
spectrum requires a very large outflow ( $p> 0.8-1$ for $R_{\rm out} =
10^5-10^4 R_{\rm S}$) in order to find a solution.

Overall, this interpretation strains the model of Blandford \&
Begelmann in several ways. First, it requires a very extended
($10^4-10^5 R_*$) radiatively-inefficient region with a
maximally-outflowing flow, in which accretion energy from a very small
fraction of the gas $\sim \!\!10^{-5}\!-\!10^{-4}$ is contributing
equally both to powering an outflow and producing the observed
radiation. Such a large amount of radiation is not a necessary
consequence of the ADIOS model, and only applies in the present case
because there is so much hot matter in the outer parts of the
disc. Furthermore, with a temperature of 18 keV, the gas around $R_{\rm
  out}$ has a sound speed equal to or considerably greater than the
Keplerian velocity of the flow, meaning that it will be essentially
unbound. This is in contrast to the BB99 model which predicts a sound
speed of at most $c_{\rm s} \sim 0.6-0.8 v_{\rm K}$. This mismatch is
only excerbated by the observation that the spectral index hardens as
the accretion rate decreases (Chakrabarty+2014 and Cackett+2012??),
which Chakabarty2014 interpret as evidence of an increased temperature
in the gas.

The near-balance and covarying light curves of the thermal and
non-thermal spectral components also presents a challenge for the
ADIOS interpretation. As discussed in BB99, the ADIOS model can be
extremely radiatively inefficient: the amount of radiation from the
flow can be arbitrarily small, since most of the accretion energy is
used to liberate the gas in an outflow. The fact that this source has
nearly equal thermal and non-thermal components (and that roughly the
same behaviour is seen in several other quiescent neutron stars like
xxxxxxxx) is therefore a coincidence. At $10^4R_{\rm S}$ the
characteristic accretion time, $t_{\rm visc} \sim r/v_r = (10/\eta)
\sqrt{GM_*/R^3}$ is about 770 seconds, or nearly an order of magnitude
larger than the observed timescale for covariance of the two spectral
components, which suggests that the two components are causally linked
on shorted timescales than the ADIOS model would predict.

Some of these problems can be alleviated by uncertainty in the
accretion rate. As noted in Chakrabarty+2014, Cen X-4 could be in a
strong propeller state, in which most of the accretion flow that makes
it all the way to the star's magnetosphere is expelled in an outflow
before it accretes onto the star. The thermal component from the
neutron star surface would then be a reflection of the rate at which
residual gas hits the star rather than the accretion rate in the inner
part of the accretion flow, which could then be much higher. This
could resolve the energetic difficulties of the model, since a higher
accretion rate will have more gas for the same temperature, so that a
weaker outflow and perhaps smaller ADIOS region is necessary to
produce the observed emission. However (beyond the question of whether
a strong propeller can actually easily form), this solution does even
worse at explaining the covariation of the thermal and non-thermal
components and their near equality, since there is now a strong
propeller that severs the connection between the amount of gas hitting
the star and the amount radiating in the accretion flows outer
regions. Furthermore, as we discussed in sec. \ref{sec:CenX4}, there
is no evidence for pulsations in Cen X-4 (and several other similar
quiescent neutron stars) even though the neutron surface can clearly
be seen which raises strong doubts that the neutron star is actually
channelling matter. We thus consider this possibility unlikely, and
conclude that the non-thermal component does not originate in a
large-scale ADIOS model, as proposed by Chakrabarty+2014.

\subsubsection{Radiation from the inner part of flow}
\label{sec:inner}
The hardness of the non-thermal spectrum and the low X-ray cutoff sets
considerable constraints on the emission mechanism and its
geometry. For one thing, the spectral shape essentially excludes the
inverse Compton scattering as the emission mechanism, since it
requires an extremely high optical depth ($\tau 4-9$, depending on the geometry) and low
temperature (6 keV). Chakrabarty+2014 showed that a RIAF-type geometry
(with a large geometric scaleheight for the flow) cannot produce the required
amount of emission. 

In principle this emission could come from inverse Compton scattering
from a thick higher temperature corona covering a Shakura-Sunyaev-type
thin disc, but a simple energy balance calculation shows this is
extremely unlikely. From the Chakrabarty+2014 fit of the non-thermal
component with an Inverse Compton spectrum from a disk, they obtain
$\tau \sim 9$ and $k_{\rm B}T \sim 6 {\rm keV}$. The scaleheight of
such a corona (assuming hydrostatic equilibrium) would then be:
\begin{equation}
\frac{H}{R} = \left(\frac{kTR}{m_{\rm p} GM_*}\right)^{0.5} \sim 0.01,
\end{equation}
which is about $10^4$cm in the inner parts of the flow. Furthermode,
the energy balance between the surface corona and underlying disc can
prevent the power-law index from becoming harder than $\Gamma \sim 2$
(Haardt \& Maraschi 1991).

It is straightforward to show that such a small scaleheight requires
too high a density for the temperature. For an optical depth of $\tau
= \kappa \rho H\sim 9$, the surface density of the corona will have to
be (assuming hydrogen gas and that electron scattering is the
principle form of opacity):

\begin{equation}
H N_e =  1.3 \times 10^{25} {\rm cm^{-2}}\left(\frac{\kappa}{0.4 {\rm
      g^{-1}~cm^{2}}}\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{m}{1.6\times10^{-24}{~\rm
      g^{-1}}}\right).
\end{equation}

This implies a number density of $N_{\rm e} \sim 10^{21} {\rm
  cm^{-2}}$, which is too high for heating (from turbulent viscosity)
to balance radiative losses from bremsstrahlung, as the following
argument shows. {\tt just show radiative losses from Bremsstrahlung }

% {\tt Assume that energy is dissipated locally so that the
% disc is radiatively efficient (as in a thin disc), and that a fraction
% of the accretion energy $f$ is deposited in the corona, while $(1-f)$
% is in the underlying thin disk. Heating will be balanced by thermal
% bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton scattering. The energy balance
% equation (as a function of radius) per unit disc area will be:

% \begin{equation}
% \frac{3GM\dot{M}}{8\pi R^3} f = 1.22\times10^{-27}T^{1/2}_{\rm e}
% N^2_{\rm e} H + \frac{4 k T_{\rm e}}{m_{\rm e}c^2} c
% \sigma_{\rm T} N_{\rm e} H \frac{3 GM\dot{M}}{16\pi R^3 c} (1-f/2).
% \end{equation}

% In the above equation, the first term represents bremsstrahlung
% cooling and the second Inverse Compton scattering.  The underlying
% disc is assumed to be heated by some of the energy in the corona that
% shines back down on it (hence the extra factor f/2).
Assuming $\dot{M}
= 4.3\times10^{12} {\rm g~s^{-1}}$, the local heating rate in the
inner disc will be $\sim 3\times10^{19} {\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$
while bremsstrahlung emission will dominate the radiative cooling and
be much larger: $\sim 1.8\times 10^{23} {\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$. The
solution is thus not physically consistent and we conclude the
emission cannot come from a corona above a thin disc.

Another possibility not considered by Chakarabarty+2014 is that the
spectral break comes from `reflection' (Ross \& Fabian) of a strong
non-thermal power-law spectrum off a much cooler dense surface (like
the face of an accretion disc or the neutron star surface). In this case we
would expect to see a strong K-$\alpha$ iron emission line, which is
not seen at all in the spectrum. Nonetheless, in order to conclusively
exclude this model, we refit the observed $NuStar$ spectrum with a
power-law and reflected component modified by GR and rotation
effects.{\tt Joel will do this...write this paragraph in
  consequence. I suggest using the Laor blurring model which will
  over-allow the amount of blurring. Hopefully this can be excluded
  altogether}.

The conclusion of this section is that there is no obvious way for the
accretion flow at such a low accretion rate to produce the (apparent)
bremsstrahlung emission unless the accretion rate at the inner edge is
considerably larger than implied by the observed emission. This case
requires a strong propeller, which then does not explain the apparent
balance between thermal and non-thermal components, nor the short
timescale covariance of these components. 

\subsection{Emission from the boundary layer}
\label{ref:boundary}
Given that more than half the emission comes from a thermal component
(interpreted to be the stellar surface heated by accreting gas) and
that the two spectral components are roughly equal and covary, it is
natural to suggest the non-thermal component also originates close to
the neutron star surface. As outlined in section \ref{sec:chakra} and
\ref{sec:inner}, it is difficult to envision a physically plausible
scenario in which the non-thermal emission comes from the accretion
flow. We thus suggest that it originates from the boundary layer: the
region where the infalling gas rapidly transitions from Keplerian
orbits to settling onto the star. As discussed in section
\ref{sec:models}, a large fraction (typically at least $1/3\!\!-\!\!1/2$) of
the total accretion energy must be dissipated in this region, and
there is no reason to assume that this energy will all be immediately
and efficiently thermalized and emitted as black-body radiation.

If all the radiation is emitted from the boundary region (and heating
by the stellar surface) this means that the flow itself is essentially
undetected. This is an exciting conclusion: it demonstrates
unambiguously both that radiatively inefficient flows exist and also
puts a constraint on the accretion rate (at least in the inner
regions of the flow) at which they exist. {\tt at some point remark on why NS are
  so much better than BH to study this: see them at all accretion
  rates/luminosities, surface emission can tell you what is happening
  in central regions of the system; also want to re-interpret the UV
  emission: how bright should the inner edge of the accretion disc be
  from reprocessed emission? This can set a limit on *where* the inner
  edge of the disc is, i.e where the outer edge of the RIAF is} In the
next section we reanalyse the $NuStar$ data to put an upper limit on
the strength of any additional power-law component (that would come
from the accretion flow), which can put an upper limit on the
radiative efficiency of the flow. 

In this section however, we put some simple constraints on the
boundary layer emission properties and comment on what this
observation can demonstrate about boundary layer physics (which is
also very poorly understood). A more detailed analysis of the boundary
layer (including how emission properties from this region will change with
accretion rate) will follow in a companion paper.

As demonstrated in the previous section and Chakrabarty+2014
concluded, the most plausible emission model for the flow is optically
thin thermal bremsstrahlung. Comptonization is excluded since if the
optical depth were high enough to produce the emission it would
completely obscure the surface emission from the star. Synchrotron
emission may also be important if the boundary layer has magnetic
turbulence with $\beta = P_{\rm gas}/P_{\rm B} \sim 1$, but this will
have a quasi-thermal shape (cite paper I found that calculated this),
while synchrotron emission from shocks typically has a much higher
cutoff energy (cite).

If the boundary layer covers the surface of the star with a
scaleheight $H$ and emits bremsstrahlung radiation, the non-thermal
luminosity can be used to define the relationship between density and
scaleheight:
\begin{eqnarray}
L_{\rm ff} &=& U_{ff} 4\pi R_*^2 H\\
\nonumber&=& 1.5\times10^{-41} n_{\rm e}^2 H \left(\frac{R_*}{10^6{\rm
      cm}}\right)^2 {\rm erg~ s^{-1}}.
\end{eqnarray}
(As before we assume a Gaunt factor of $g\sim 1.2$ and ionized
hydrogen gas).  Thus:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:n2H}
n_{\rm e}^2H = 3.4\times10^{41}\left(\frac{R_*}{10^6{\rm cm}}\right)^{-2}
\left(\frac{L_{\rm ff}}{6\times10^{32} {\rm erg~s^{-1}}}\right) \rm{cm^{-5}}.
\end{equation}

Since the spectrum is dominated by Bremsstrahlung emission, this must
dominate over losses from inverse Compton scattering. This sets a firm
lower limit on the density in the layer (and upper limit on the scale
height). The energy density of Inverse Compton scattering will be:

\begin{equation}
U_{\rm IC} = \frac{4kT_{\rm e}}{m_ec^2} c \sigma_{\rm T} n_{\rm e}
\frac{L_{\rm BB}}{8\pi R_*^2c} {\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-3}},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{\rm T}$ is the Thomson cross-section and $L_{\rm
  BB}\!\!\sim 6\!\!\times 10^{32} {\rm erg~s^{-1}}$ is the quasi-thermal
emission from the surface of the star. Requiring that $U_{\rm
  ff}/U_{\rm IC} > 1$ (where $U_{\rm ff}$ is given by eq. (\ref{eq:brems})) and
using the measured electron temperature $kT_{\rm e} = 18{\rm keV}$, we
find that the electron density must be at least:
\begin{equation}
n_{\rm e} \geq 10^{17} {\rm cm}^{-3},
\end{equation}
so that the scale height is at most $H < 10^7 {\rm cm}$. This is
clearly not much of a constraint, but rather confirms that
bremsstrahlung will indeed be the dominant radiation process for such
(relatively) low coronal temperatures.

We can also set an upper limit on the density of the boundary layer
from considering the accretion rate required to match the observed
luminosity and making a reasonable guess about the infall
velocity. Assuming the entire luminosity ($L_{\rm tot}$) comes from the boundary
layer, the accretion rate onto the star will be:
\begin{equation}
\dot{M} = \frac{L_{TOT}}{v^2_{\rm K}\mathcal{F}_{\rm BL}},
\end{equation}
where $v_{\rm K} \equiv (GM_*R_*^{-1})^{1/2}$ is the Keplerian
velocity at $R_*$. Since the radiation is divided up into a thermal
and non-thermal component, we can immediately relate the accretion
rate to the number density by using equation \ref{eq:n2H}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lum}
\dot{M}v^2_{\rm K}\mathcal{F}_{\rm BL} = 1.8\times10^{-23}
\frac{L_{\rm TOT}}{L_{\rm ff}} n_{\rm e}^2 H.
\end{equation} 
Assuming radial infall, the accretion rate onto the star will be:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mdot}
\dot{M} = 4\pi R_*^2 m_{\rm p} n_{\rm e} v_{\rm R},
\end{equation}
where $v_{\rm R}$ is the radial infall velocity. Substituting
eq. \ref{eq:mdot} into eq. \ref{eq:lum} the number density of the gas
will be:
\begin{equation}
  n_{\rm e} = 5.6\times 10^{22} \frac{L_{\rm ff}}{L_{\rm
      TOT}} m_{\rm p} \mathcal{F}_{\rm BL}v^2_{\rm K}
  \frac{v_{\rm R}}{H}.
\end{equation}
This gives a somewhat counter-intuitive result: the number density of
the gas is proportional to the radial velocity, so that a higher
density implies a larger radial velocity. This is because of the $n^2$
dependence in the bremsstrahlung emission -- a higher accretion rate
requires the density increase as $n^2$ to radiate the additional
energy away by bremsstrahlung.

The boundary layer (assuming no magnetosphere) is expected to be
strongly turbulent, since infalling gas must transition from Keplerian
orbits to co-rotation with the star. Shakura \& Sunyaev 1988/1999
derived some simple physical properties of the boundary layer,
assuming that Prandtl-type turbulence flow develops. The net infall
velocity of the gas can be expressed:
\begin{equation}
v_{\rm r} \simeq v_{\rm K} \frac{\mathcal{M}^2 (3 + \Omega_*/\Omega_K)}{2C}\frac{H}{R_*},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{M}$ is the Mach number of the flow, $\Omega_*/\Omega_{\rm
  K}$ is the ratio of the stellar spin frequency to the Keplerian
frequency in the inner disc and $C$ is a numerical parameter of order
unity (representing uncertainty in the nature of the turbulence). If
we assume strong, nearly super-sonic turbulence $\mathcal{M} \sim 1$, the
maximum infall velocity will be:
\begin{equation}
v_{\rm r} \simeq \frac{3}{2}\frac{H}{R_*}v_{\rm K, *}.
\end{equation}

This corresponds to a maximum density for the accretion flow:
\begin{equation}
n_{\rm e} < 7 \times 10^{22} {\rm cm^3}, 
\end{equation}
which again is not very constraining (it demands $H\> 10^{-5} {\rm
  cm}$) but at least is consistent with expectation.

Considering the problem from another perspective, if we assume that
the scale height of the flow is similar to the hydrostatic scaleheight
for the corona of $kT_{\rm keV}$ and gas temperature $c_{\rm s} \sim
1.3\times10^8 {\rm cm~s^{-1}}$ then :

\begin{equation}
H \sim  R_* \left(\frac{c_{\rm s}}{v_{\rm K}}\right)^2 \sim 10^2 {\rm cm},
\end{equation}
which is consistent with the limits we have derived and implies a
number density of $n_{\rm e} \sim 6\times10^{19} {\rm cm^{-3}}$ (note
that this implies a Compton optical depth $\tau \sim \sigma_{\rm T}nH
< 10^{-2}$, so that Comptonization will essentially be irrelevant).

This solution implies that the boundary layer is a single temperature
gas. This will be true as long as the density is high enough for the
ions and electrons to maintain collisional equilibrium faster than the
ions can heat (via turbulence) or the electrons can cool by
radiating. As a final check on our solution above, we can compare the
predicted turbulent heating timescale (the infall time), the cooling
timescale (bremsstrahlung emission from electrons) and the timescale
for the electrons and ions to reach collisional equilibrium.

The characteristic heating time for the gas will be approximately the
infall time:
\begin{equation}
t_{\rm heat} \simeq \frac{H}{v_{\rm r}}  \simeq \Omega_K =
7.6\times10^{-5} {\rm s},
\end{equation}
while the timescale for the gas to cool via bremsstrahlung emission
will be:
\begin{eqnarray}
t_{\rm ff} &\simeq& 4\times10^{-13}\rho^{-1}T_{\rm e}^{1/2} {\rm s}\\
\nonumber &=& 5.7\times10^{-5}\left(\frac{n_{\rm e}}{6\times10^{19}
      {\rm cm^{-3}}}\right)^{-1} {\rm s}.
\end{eqnarray}

The timescale for electrons and ions to reach equilibrium will be
(cite Boyd \& Sanderson):
\begin{equation}
t_{\rm e-i} = \frac{4.6\times10^{-23} T_{\rm e}^{2/3}}{\rho}\left(1 +
  \frac{1}{\tau}\right) \rm{s},
\end{equation} 
where $\tau \equiv (T_{\rm i} - T_{\rm e})/T_{\rm e}$ is the
fractional difference between the ion and electron temperatures. For
our lower-limit on density $n_{\rm e} > 10^{17} cm^{-3}$, it is easy
to see that $t_{\rm e-i} < t_{\rm heat}$ is easily satisfied for a
single-temperature plasma:
\begin{equation}
t_{\rm e-i} <  9.4\times10^{-11}(1 + \frac{1}{\tau}){\rm s}.
\end{equation}
A fractional temperature difference of $\sim 10^{-7}$ will be enough
to maintain collisional equilibrium on a timescale similar to $t_{\rm heat}$.

In a further paper we will investigate the physical properties of the
boundary layer in more depth, and in particular derive a relationship
between accretion rate and temperature (as reported by Cackett+ and
Chakrabarty+), as well as investigate the implications of the near
equilibrium between thermal and non-thermal components by constructing. Since the main
object of our current paper is to demonstrate that the boundary layer
can naturally account for the entire quiescent emission observed from
Cen X-4, we thus leave further investigation of the boundary layer
itself to a future work, and now turn to setting constraints on the
radiative-inefficiency of the flow based on its non-detection.

%     calculation}
% \end{itemize}

\subsection{How Radiatively Inefficient is the flow?}
\label{sec:RIAF}
\begin{itemize}
\item{We need the upper limits of detectability from Nustar for a power law spectral component above 10keV {\tt I don't know exactly how to do this}}
\item{We don't detect the accretion flow at all. The maximum intrinsic
    radiative efficiency for the flow would occur if it were
    radiatively inefficient from having a large magnetosphere. If the
    star spins at P=1s, the corotation radius is at 78km; at P=1ms it
    is at 17km.}
\item{The ``strong propeller'' case is basically a black box: we don't
    know how efficiently it could actually expel matter. In the same
    way, once you say strong propeller 100x more material could be
    expelled than is being accreted, so all the arguments about the
    observed luminosity can be totally irrelevant for determining the
    underlying accretion rate through the majority of the disk. The
    only limit can be on when you are expelling enough material to
    observably change the absorption column (e.g. $\simeq 10^{21} {\rm
      cm}^{-2}$) or start really Compton scattering the radiation from
    the star (which will produce another hard component). I will
    calculate this because it is an important number, but it may not
    offer strong constraints if the disk is really truncated}
\item{Another possibility: a truncated flow with a dead disk. In this
    case the accretion rate at the inner edge matches the one onto the
    star and $R_{\rm in} \sim R_{\rm co}$ (or $R_{\rm in} < R_{\rm
      co}$ if the magnetic field is really weak). Here the unknown is
    the spin rate of the star. The slower it spins the further away
    $R_{\rm co}$ is. This is basically the extreme case of the
    ``strong propeller'', since there is as little mass travelling
    through the disk as possible. Without knowing the spin period
    there are not really constraints on the radiative efficiency, so
    we are stuck making arguments about the plausibility of such a
    scenario}

\item{However: there is no evidence that Cen X-4 has a
    magnetosphere. There are no pulsations (upper limits xxx), the
    Type I bursts indicate weak field, so maybe there is no
    truncation? (this would suggest a field of $10^5$G) In that case,
    the disk accretes up to the surface and there *should* be
    radiation from the flow. Can estimate how dense it would be
    (assume spherical, assume some accretion rate) and then check how
    bright it would be if it were illuminated by NS surface (nb. here
    it would be possible to do Monto Carlo simulations of what the
    spectrum of the NS surface scattered through an atmosphere would
    look like using the code I have from a former colleague.}

\item{The above estimate is the most optimistic constraint we have to
    demonstrate that the flow is intrinsically radiatively inefficient
    (i.e. there is a demonstrable mis-match between the amount of mass
    moving through the disk and how bright it is) Obviously it would
    be nicer to confirm that there are actually two components (which
    would mean detecting two distinct high energy components, or a
    upward-turning break in the spectrum): NuStar might be able to do
    that, depending on the relative strength of the two components}
\end{itemize}

% \subsection{Could the accretion flow be detectable in other sources/at higher luminosities?}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item{Following the logic of the last section, in the scenario we have
%     sketched out we can make predictions for how the luminosity would
%     change with accretion rate if we assume that the flow is roughly
%     spherical and cooled mainly by Inverse Compton scattering and the
%     surface emission keeps scaling as it did before (i.e. the
%     turbulent heating of the boundary layer and the cooling of the
%     protons is a linear function of accretion rate).}
% \item{At some point, the inner flow should start to become bright
%     enough to be detected. If it is at the same point that the optical
%     depth starts reaching unity, then we might only detect the power
%     law component and not see the emission from the neutron star at
%     all.}
% \item{This isn't a totally parameter-free calculation to do because
%     you have to assume something about the heating rate of the gas
%     (from the accretion flow, because a lot of that energy will go to
%     launching an outflow), but if I do that then I can estimate the
%     temperature of the gas when it is being cooled by emission from
%     the neutron star. This will predict a spectrum for the accretion
%     flow and how it changes with accretion rate. Since the luminosity
%     will probably scale approximately like $\dot{M}^2$, at some point
%     there should be a steep rise in luminosity even though the
%     accretion rate has only changed a little bit}
% \item{This roughly fits with the picture of what is seen for accreting neutron stars, but it might be good to relate this to some specific sources?}
% \end{itemize}
\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
In this paper we have argued that the quiescent emission from the
neutron star Cen X-4 originates entirely from accretion onto the
surface of the star (most likely without strong modulation by the
magnetic field), rather than in the accretion flow itself. This
conclusion has consequences for both on the properties of the
accretion flow (beyond its intrinsic radiative inefficiency) and the
neutron star itself, and suggests future observations that can better
constrain the properties of both.

The very low luminosity of Cen X-4 disfavours a strongly advecting
flow (ADAF), since a very low rate of energy release onto the surface
of the neutron star, contrary to the ADAF model in which the majority
of the accretion energy is carried onto the central object. This
conclusion is the same as Bernardini+2014 and contrary to that of
Menou \& McClintock, who ascribed the low surface emission from Cen
X-4 as evidence of a strong magnetic propeller. As we have argued in
this paper, Cen X-4 shows no evidence for magnetic activity at any
luminosity: our pulse search shows no evidence for pulsations, which
should be present if there is a strong magnetic field channelling the
flow. It seems more likely that the majority of the accretion flow is
prevented from reaching the star, as is proposed by several RIAF
models (citations).

These models generally require substantially more gas in the accretion
flow than is accreted onto the star, and this gas could obscure the
stellar surface if the density is high enough and the inclination
angle low enough.  As shown in sec. \ref{sec:RIAF} our non-detection
of the flow does not set a firm constraint on the density of the
accretion flow, since at such low luminosities even the relatively
massive disc predicted by the ADIOS model in Chakrabarty+2014 will be
very optically thin to electron scattering ($\tau \sim
10^{-3}$). However, if the system's inclination is low enough and the
scale height of the flow stays roughly constant, the optical depth of
through the flow should increase with the accretion rate, so that
observing nearby neutron stars in a very low state
($10^{-4}-10^{-3}L_{\rm Edd}$) will see the emission from the
accretion flow and partly obscured emission from the star. It may be
possible to detect non-thermal emission from both the central star and
the accretion flow. Since the gas in the flow and the surface should
have different temperatures and densities, this could manifest in the
hard X-rays as two power-law components: a break in the hard X-rays
(from where the surface emission's spectrum turns over) and a second
power law component with a lower intensity extending to higher
energies (from the moderatly optically-thin accretion flow). A firm
detection of multiple power-law components would put strong
constraints on the radiative efficiency of the flow, since it would
constrain the relative intensity of each component. 

Thermal radiation from the surface of the star could also be used to
constrain the optical depth of the accretion flow. Assuming that the
entire surface of the star is radiating (which seems reasonable for
sources like Cen X-4 which show no clear magnetic activity), a
mismatch between the measured temperature and luminosity could
indicate that part of the emission from the star is being scattered by
the accretion flow, thus setting a constraint on the effective optical
depth and (where the system's inclination is known) scale height of
the flow. This is particularly true for accreting millisecond X-ray
pulsars, where the surface is clearly seen. In these systems a
decrease in pulsation fraction could imply an increased optical depth
of the accretion flow, and be used to constrain the optical depth as a
function of luminosity.

Since the present observation of Cen X-4 shows both a thermal and
non-thermal component from the surface of the star, good modelling is
vital to understand how accreting matter hits the neutron star surface
and releases its energy. Since RIAFs are generally geometrically
thick, they generically have somewhat less specific angular momentum
than thin discs, so that the flow may be able to bombard the star on
mostly radial orbits with very little angular momentum. This case has
been studied (Zampieri, etc.) and found that particle bombardment
leads to efficient thermalization of the accretion energy, so that the
surface emits energy as a modified blackbody. In contrast, the work of
(Sunyaev+,Popham, Igomonov?, people following that) considered a disc
accreting onto a boundary layer (where the flow must redistribute
large quantities of angular momentum in order to settle onto the star)
and found most of the accretion energy is released as non-thermal
radiation from a hot corona around the star. If these models are
correct and valid even at the low accretion rates seen in Cen X-4,
then the thermal/non-thermal radiation balance could be a result of
the angular momentum distribution from the accretion flow, and could
thus be used to put an independent constraint on its scale height. Of
course, there may also be radiative coupling between the hot corona
and the cool neutron star surface, whereby the accretion energy is
deposited in the corona and partly reprocessed by the neutron star's
surface. This would imply a very low albedo for the neutron star's
surface. In a companion paper we investigate some of these questions
more thoroughly in light of all the quiescent observations of Cen X-4,
but more detailed theoretical modelling is clearly warranted.

Understanding how the thermal component is produced in Cen X-4 is also
important for observations of neutron star cooling, which track the
thermal emission from quiescent neutron stars after an outburst and
fit them with deep crustal cooling models. As we argue in this paper,
the non-thermal component in all quiescent neutron stars is most
likely generated very close to the surface of the neutron star and a
considerable fraction of the boundary layer energy can be thermalized,
either through direct heating or reprocessing from the non-thermal
corona. This extra source of energy may complicate the interpretation
of deep crustal cooling for cooling neutron stars, since this
interpretation assumes that the surface temperature of the neutron
star is determined only by the cooling of the deep crust.  {\tt Does
  it? Will it? 1. Non-thermal component not always seen (with good
  limits, if the star is so bright? Note that the component *could* be
  hard, e.g. lots of high energy radiation for reprocessing, 2. Cooling
  crusts generally more luminous in initial stages than Cen X-4, so
  heating from the non-thermal component could be irrelevant Talk to
  Joel here: what constraints could be placed? His paper claims no
  correlation between thermal temperature and non-thermal component
  strength except during large accretion flares}

Does Cen X-4 have a substantial dipolar magnetic field? If it has a
spin period of several milliseconds (like accreting millisecond X-ray
pulsars) then even a very weak field ($\sim 10^6G$) will truncate the
disc for $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-6} \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ and channel the flow
onto the stellar surface. This should most likely produce some
periodic modulation, but none is detected done to a level of $\sim
5\%$.  The `strong propeller' scenario proposed by Menou \& McClintock
required a field of at least $10^9{\rm G}$, which is about an order
of magnitude larger than typically seen in AMXPs. While it is possible
that the magnetic geometry of Cen X-4 is such that pulsations are not
seen, the relatively large number of quiescent neutron stars without
pulsations suggests that this is unlikely to be the case, although a
forthcoming search should set better constraints on this (ref. Patruno
\& Messenger, in prep). If LMXBs really don't have strong dipolar
fields, it requires a range of at least nine orders of magnitude in
magnetic field strength of neutron stars. 

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we have reanalysed the data presented in
Chakrabarty+2014 of the quiescent neutron star Cen X-4. We have argued
that the near balance between thermal and non-thermal components in
the X-ray spectrum, the relatively rapid covariation of these
components, and the shape of the non-thermal component (specifically,
its hardness and turnover around 10 keV) all suggest that the entire
X-ray spectrum is generated in a boundary layer close to the star. The
accretion flow itself is therefore undetected, down to a level of
xxx\%, directly demonstrating that the flow is radiatively
inefficient, as has been postulated by various theoretical work. We
have demonstrated how this can set some (modest) constraints on the
radiative inefficiency of the accretion flow, and suggested ways in
which observations at slightly higher luminosities with $NuStar$ could
be used to look for two power-law components (with different cut-off
energies) in the hard radiation, which would clearly constrain the
radiative efficiency of the flow. 

We conclude that there is no evidence of a strong magnetic field in
Cen X-4, based on a lack of detection of pulsations down to $5\%$ of
the total flux, and therefore agree with the conclusion of
Bernardini+2014 that a `strong magnetocentrifugal propeller' (as
proposed by Menou \& McClintock) is disfavoured. This implies a span
of $>9$ orders of magnitude in the dipolar strength of neutron
stars. In the absence of a magnetic propeller, the low luminosity of
Cen X-4 strongly favours RIAF models in which the majority of the
accretion flow is prevented from reaching the inner regions near the
star, either by launching an outflow (ADIOS) being recycled through
the flow (CDAF) or inhibited by a magnetic field
('magnetically-arrested'). We propose using the apparent luminosity
versus measured temperature of the thermal component at somewhat
higher luminosities to constrain the optical depth of the accretion
flow.

We used simple physical arguments for the non-thermal component to
constrain its density to $10^{17} < n_{\rm e} < 10^{22} {\rm
  cm^{-3}}$. This range in density corresponds to the hydrostatic
scale heigh of both a single temperature or two-temperature plasma,
although we argue that the coupling time between ions and electrons is
short enough that the plasma can probably remain at a single
temperature. 

Our conclusion is based on an empirical analysis of the data: a better
theoretical understanding of how the accretion energy is released in
the boundary layer (and in particular how the thermal component is
generated) is necessary to properly understand the implications of our
results on cooling neutron star models, as well as to possibly set
additional constraints on the properties of the accreting matter
(e.g. its temperature and angular momentum) to further constrain the
nature of the RIAF. A more thorough investigation of how accretion
flows interact with the surface layers of neutron stars is therefore
warranted.
